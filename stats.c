 * @brief <Source file of the statistical analytics program in c programming.>
 *
 * <stats program analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, 
 * minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, it will reorder this data set from large to small.
 * All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, it will 
 * print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
