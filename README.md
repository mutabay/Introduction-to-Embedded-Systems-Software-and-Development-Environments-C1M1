TASK - In this programming assignment you will create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment will help you get re-oriented with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation. We begin by setting up a version control repository on your local machine. You will then develop and test your code there. When complete, you will upload a zip of your repository to Coursera. Please read through all instructions before starting.

# stats program analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, 
# minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, it will reorder this data set from large to small.
# All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, it will 
# print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
