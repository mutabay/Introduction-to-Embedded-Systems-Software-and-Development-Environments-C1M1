##### TASK - In this programming assignment I created a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment help me to get re-oriented with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation. I began by setting up a version control repository on your local machine. Then I developed and tested my code there.   
GNU nano 4.8

stats program analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum,
minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, it will reorder this data set from large to small.    
All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, it will
print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
